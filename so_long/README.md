Let's make a mini-game using the mlx library.

### Synopsis - Dino advanture!
Dino is a young dinosaur with magic powers.  
While Dino was sleeping in a bush, evil animals kidnapped Dino and took him to the laboratory.  
The evil animals put Dino's magic rings and spell book in the middle of poisonous mushrooms.  
They thought that if Dino saw them, he'd give up and not try to escape.  
Although Dino was scared, he was brave enough to run away.  
**Move Dino with 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', escape from the poisonous mushrooms, collect magic rings and activate the spell book.**
